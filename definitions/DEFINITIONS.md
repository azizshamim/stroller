Vagabond Definitions
--------------------

Yes, these are just baseboxes from Veewee. However, there is one minor
difference to all of these definitions from what is provided in several
of the templates: Install from Packages instead of Install from Source.

You shouldn't install from source anything where possible, so grab
packages or make them yourselves.

If you'd like to contribute to baseboxes that are bundled with Vagabond,
please use packages. Otherwise, have fun
